# Where should we start? 
# What types of functions should 
# we have in our program?
# --> When the user enters rooms
# --> Handles user inputs

# Why do we have functions in programs? 
# What are they useful for?
# --> useful for organising code
# --> for code that repeats

# 1) Create a function that will handle user input
# The purpose of this function is to run the game by continuially 
# asking the user for inputs. Depending on what they input, we run
# different parts of the game!

# GENERAL PSUEDOCODE:
# def main():
# --> in a while loop that runs until the game is over,
    # --> get input from user
    # --> make sure its valid
    # --> depending on their input, run a function related 
    # to the input

# HINTS: Python Function, Python While Loops, Python inputs, 
# Python Try/Except
