# TASK: Create a Class for the character you talked about 
# at the beginning of class. Give them three properties

# the warmup, which says: 

# "1) Write a function that takes in a name as a parameter.
# When called, print to the console "Hello " + their name
# 2) If they input something that is not a word,
# give them an error that says 'Please write a name'"
