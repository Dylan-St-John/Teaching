// 3) Create a Point object constructor that has the 
// following property/methods:

// a) Take in two parameters for its x and y coordinates
// b) property for its x and y coordinates
// c) A method that draws that point to the screen (based on its x and 
// y coordinates)

// TO TEST: Create an instance of this object and call 
// its draw method - you should see a point on the screen

// 4) How do we create all the points we need? What about storing
// them for future reference? --> Create a 2 dimensional array to
// store all of the points we are going to make
